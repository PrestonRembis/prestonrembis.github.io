                <p>This was a class project where we could develop anything we wanted over the semester. We developed a text-based user interface (TUI) that interacted with the Google API. You can see your most recent emails, send emails, do Google searches from the TUI, and more. 
                    I mainly worked on the frontend which was coded in Rust, which was new to me. Overall I am very proud of this project as in my experience Rust is a quite stringent and really pushes you to think. The group was able to produce a useful tool which required weekly meetings and working on one repository in Git which gave us great workflow experience.</p>

                <p>My senior capstone project is a web and mobile application for events. The application was coded in Dart for the frontend and Javascript for the backend.
                    I focused mainly on the frontend of the application. I worked in a group with 3 others throughout 2 semesters. Throughout the semesters we did an agile workflow.
                    Sprints were two weeks long and we had to have at least 10 hours of work assigned for each person for each sprint. As a group we met twice weekly and did a basic standup meeting
                    where sprint progress was discussed and worked out any issues with the application. We worked with a client who we met with throughout the semesters to communicate progress
                    and get feedback on the application to satisfy the client's requirements.
